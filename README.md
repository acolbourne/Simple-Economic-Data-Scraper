# Simple Economic Data Scraper
The objective of this simple scraper is to collect and print out a list of events, dates and times from an economic calendar website. The output could then be reused as part of another project, such as the gatekeeping process of an execution algorithm, for instance. I haven't modified the output after collecting it, but you can do this in any way you feel necessary.

I've used the calendar at https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar for this project, but the process of extracting data from other calendars would be very similar.
